So when you normally wrap a markdown list in a div for styling, the Markdown parser just skips over all the markdown within the div block.</p> <p>However, with the <code>md-in-html</code> extension enabled, the content of a raw HTML block-level element is always parsed as Markdown. You can turn this on by including a <code>markdown</code> attribute on the opening tag. The markdown attribute will be stripped from the output, while all other attributes will be preserved.</p> <p>After you enable the <code>md-in-html</code> extension, you can add Markdown text inside an HTML element like <code>`div</code>.
