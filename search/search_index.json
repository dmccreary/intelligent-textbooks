You\u2019re ten years old. You aren't studying; you are massaging your teacher\u2019s shoulders because that is what \"respect\" looks like. But your eyes are locked on the desk. Between you and three other kids lies a single, decaying object: The Textbook. It didn\u2019t just look old. It looked alive. It was covered in black and green mold\u2014a biological hazard posing as a math book.</p> <p>The \"Moldy Mosaic\" Strategy</p> <p>In 1990s Indonesia, we didn\u2019t own knowledge. We \"rented\" it from the state.</p> <ul> <li>The Struggle: The pages were so rotted by fungi that Page 42 was unreadable in my book.</li> <li>The Hack: My deskmate\u2019s book was missing Page 43.</li> <li>The Win: We had to cross-reference our \"moldy mosaics\" just to finish a homework set.</li> </ul> <p>If you couldn\u2019t read the text, you didn't go to Google. You went on a scavenger hunt. You got lucky if the mold didn't eat the same paragraph in two different books. This was survivalist learning. Jungle Discovery Mode: The PhD Leap Fast forward twenty years. I am standing on a university campus in the United States. I am finishing a PhD. To the world, I\u2019m a scholar. To myself, I\u2019m still that kid from Surabaya/Medan hacking through a jungle with a butter knife.</p> <ul> <li>The Barrier: My family never finished middle school.</li> <li>The Reality: I didn't have a map for college. No \"legacy\" advice. No \"insider\" tips.</li> <li>The Mode: I was in Full Jungle Discovery Mode. Every syllabus, every grant application, every networking event was a vine I had to cut through just to see the sun.</li> </ul> <p>The Great Equalizer: The End of Luck Here is the \"Beginning After the End\" moment. Back then, your destiny was tied to the quality of the moldy book the teacher handed you. If you were in a poor village, you were stuck. That era is dead.</p> <p>With a low-cost old laptop and an internet connections, the walls have crumbled.</p> <ul> <li>The MIT Desk: A kid in a remote Indonesian village now sits in the same \"virtual\" front row as a billionaire\u2019s son.</li> <li>You don't need a local hero. You can study the mental models of the world's greatest engineers or the coding logic of the world\u2019s best engineers in real-time.</li> <li>The AI Guide: AI is the \"Master\" who never gets tired of your questions. It doesn't ask you to massage its shoulders. It just gives you the light.</li> </ul> <p>The Final Boss: Your Own Mind</p> <p>We are moving toward a Starlink Reality. When high-speed internet hits every corner of the archipelago, the \"infrastructure\" excuse vanishes. The bottleneck is no longer the book. The bottleneck is the prompt.</p> <p>If you have the internet, you have the keys to the kingdom. The only thing standing between a kid in a Surabaya alleyway and a PhD in the Ivy League is the courage to ask the right questions.</p> <p>The \"Jungle\" has been paved. Now, the only question is: How fast can you run? Next Step for You</p> <p>Background for Education in remote Indonesian</p> <p>The memory of textbooks being \"given\" by teachers but requiring return is 100% accurate. This was the Buku Paket (Package Book) system, a central pillar of the New Order's educational infrastructure in the 1990s.</p> <p>\u200bThe \"Buku Paket\" Experience</p> <p>\u200bThe Loan Ritual: At the start of the school year, teachers or librarians distributed a set of government-issued books. These were not gifts; they were state property on loan. \u200bThe Inventory Check: Every book had a unique school stamp or number. At the end of the year, you were required to return them. If you lost one, you had to replace it\u2014this is a major reason why the Titi Gantung used-book market was so essential. \u200bThe Penalty: If a book was damaged or missing, parents often had to pay a fine or find a replacement copy to \"hand back\" to the school library.</p> <p>\u200bWhy They Were Handed Out</p> <p>\u200bCentralized Control: The Ministry of Education controlled 100% of the content to ensure a uniform national narrative, particularly in History and PMP (Civics).</p> <p>\u200bSubsidized Scarcity: The state aimed to remove the cost barrier for families. However, they rarely printed enough for a 1:1 ratio, which caused the \"propel share\" (sharing) dynamic where two students sat side-by-side with one battered book.</p> <p>\u200bThe Ritual of \"Sampul Buku\" (Book Covering) \u200bTo ensure books survived the year for the next student, schools enforced a strict covering ritual:</p> <p>\u200bBrown Paper (Sampul Cokelat): Every student had to wrap their borrowed books in standard brown paper. \u200bThe Plastic Layer: You then added a layer of clear plastic to protect against rain and Medan\u2019s humidity. \u200bThe Irony: Ironically, the moisture trapped under that plastic cover often accelerated the growth of the mold you remember, as the paper couldn't \"breathe.\"</p> <p>Hadi: I grew up probably in surabaya elementary school in Indonesia. And I remember as a kid, we will be asked to message our teacher shoulder because they are our elder. And while I don't remember the full detail or buku packet. I remember that I have to share book. And ewww, this moldy book.</p> <p>And... If I can't read the text because it's moldy I have to find other book that we usually get lucky because the mold is not in the same page.</p> <p>We had to share text book between desk mate (or sometime even 4 people share one book). And we must return book after class. Nobody own book back then.</p> <p>And fast forward, through a series of coincidences, eventually  I get PhD in United States. But it's hard because my family members never graduate from middle school. Navigating college in a different country and first time college really is full in jungle discovery mode right? </p> <p>But with Ai now, it feels like that kid in Indonesia can have the opportunity to learn from the best teacher in MIT through an intelligent textbook. And this truly will give hope to people in impoverished countries, assuming they have internet. (which has gotten better). And who knows, maybe Starlink will enter Indonesia and change the internet access paradigm. But these intelligent books are the ray of the hope for the future. If you have access to internet and a device that has internet. If somebody guide you buy asking the right questions. Only your own mind is your limiting factor.
