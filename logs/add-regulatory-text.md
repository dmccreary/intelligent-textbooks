## Content Added

### Paragraph 1: Specific Regulations

Covers privacy laws protecting student data:

- **United States:**
  - FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) - governs access to educational records
  - COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) - additional requirements for students under 13

- **European Union:**
  - GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) - strict requirements on personal data
  - "Right to be forgotten" - requires complete deletion from databases, backups, and log files

### Paragraph 2: Compliance Burden

Discusses practical implications for educators and institutions:

- Organizations must demonstrate data protection to auditors
- Increased risk exposure for teachers and schools holding student records
- Data breaches or compliance failures can result in fines and reputational damage
- Infrastructure requirements for compliant Level 3 systems drive up development and operational costs
- The Level 2 → Level 3 transition is far more significant than just adding personalization features

## Location in Chapter

The new paragraphs were inserted after the existing privacy threshold paragraph and before Figure 1.3 (Privacy Threshold bar chart).
