## 📖 About

This project is a series of resources to help teachers worldwide create the foundation for **free and open intelligent textbooks**. Our focus is on helping instructors create Level 2 textbooks that use a [learning graph](https://dmccreary.github.io/intelligent-textbooks/glossary/#learning-graph) as their core data structure to ground content generation and guide learning agents.

### Why Intelligent Textbooks?

Traditional textbooks are static. Intelligent textbooks adapt to learners, provide interactive experiences, and leverage AI to create personalized educational content. This project demonstrates how to build textbooks that:

- **Adapt to individual learning paths** using concept dependency graphs
- **Provide interactive simulations** (MicroSims) for hands-on learning  
- **Generate content dynamically** using AI prompts and workflows
- **Scale globally** using free, open-source tools

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)** - Static site generator optimized for documentation
- **[Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)** - Modern, responsive theme with advanced features
- **[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)** - Interactive simulations and visualizations
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** - Content processing and analytics scripts
- **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** - Free hosting for public educational content

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **MicroSims** | Interactive p5.js simulations embedded via iframes |
| **Learning Graphs** | Concept dependency visualizations and data |
| **AI Prompts** | Structured prompts for content generation workflows |
| **Custom Plugins** | Social media card overrides and extensions |
| **Analytics Tools** | Python scripts for site metrics and content analysis |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) (recommended) or pip
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dmccreary/intelligent-textbooks.git
   cd intelligent-textbooks
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   # Using conda (recommended)
   conda create -n mkdocs python=3
   conda activate mkdocs
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install mkdocs "mkdocs-material[imaging]"
   ```

3. **For social card generation (macOS)**
   ```bash
   brew install cairo freetype libffi libjpeg libpng zlib
   export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib
   ```

### Development

```bash
# Build the site
mkdocs build

# Run local development server
mkdocs serve
# Visit http://localhost:8000

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

## 📚 Content Areas

## 🛠️ Creating MicroSims

MicroSims are self-contained interactive educational simulations. Each follows this structure:

```
docs/sims/your-sim-name/
├── index.md          # Documentation and embedding
├── main.html         # Standalone HTML page  
└── your-sim-name.js  # p5.js simulation code
```

**Template Usage:** Start with `docs/sims/templates/` for consistent structure and styling.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how to get started:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. **Open** a Pull Request

### Contribution Guidelines

- Follow existing MicroSim structure for interactive content

## 🎯 Educational Philosophy

This project implements concepts from Neal Stephenson's "The Diamond Age," specifically the **Young Lady's Illustrated Primer** - a vision of adaptive, personalized educational technology that:

- Generates content in real-time based on learner needs
- Uses interactive storytelling and simulations  
- Implements learning graphs for optimal concept sequencing
- Provides scaffolded support that adapts to individual progress
