# Quality Assessment Framework for Intelligent Textbooks

A comprehensive framework for evaluating intelligent textbooks across five key dimensions.

## Overview

This 20-question framework assesses textbooks on a scale to determine quality and intelligence level. Use this both during development (formative assessment) and after completion (summative assessment).
