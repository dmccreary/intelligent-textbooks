# Skills for Generating Intelligent Textbooks

This directory contains skills for generating the components of
an intelligent textbook.  There is an overall skill
for generating the mkdocs file structure, but then
there are other skills for generating content such
as chapter content and MicroSims.

The process of generating skills was created by Anthropic in [October 2025](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills).
Anthropic also has provided detailed examples of the generation of [PowerPoint files](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/document-skills/pptx).

See the [Skill for creating Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
