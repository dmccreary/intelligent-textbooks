# Quiz Generator

Generate interactive multiple-choice quizzes for textbook chapters with Bloom's Taxonomy alignment and quality distractor analysis.

## Purpose

This skill automates quiz creation for intelligent textbooks by analyzing chapter content to generate contextually relevant multiple-choice questions. Each quiz is aligned to specific concepts from the learning graph, distributed across Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive levels, and formatted using mkdocs-material question admonitions with upper-alpha (A, B, C, D) answer choices. The skill ensures quality distractors, balanced answer distribution, and comprehensive explanations for educational value.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill after:

1. Chapter content has been generated or written (1000+ words per chapter)
2. Learning graph exists with concept dependencies
3. Glossary is available (recommended for terminology questions)

Trigger this skill when:

- Creating quizzes for new chapters
- Updating quizzes after content revisions
- Building comprehensive quiz bank for entire textbook
- Exporting quiz data for LMS or chatbot integration

The skill can run incrementally (chapter by chapter) or in batch mode (entire textbook).

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Content Readiness

Calculate content readiness score (1-100) for each target chapter:

**Quality Checks:**

1. **Chapter word count:**
   - 2000+ words = excellent (20 pts)
   - 1000-1999 words = good (15 pts)
   - 500-999 words = basic (10 pts)
   - <500 words = insufficient (5 pts)

2. **Example coverage:**
   - 60%+ concepts with examples = excellent (20 pts)
   - 40-59% = good (15 pts)
   - 20-39% = basic (10 pts)
   - <20% = insufficient (5 pts)

3. **Glossary coverage:**
   - 80%+ chapter concepts defined = excellent (20 pts)
   - 60-79% = good (15 pts)
   - 40-59% = basic (10 pts)
   - <40% = insufficient (5 pts)

4. **Concept clarity:**
   - Clear explanations for all concepts (20 pts)
   - Most concepts clear (15 pts)
   - Some unclear concepts (10 pts)
   - Many unclear concepts (5 pts)

5. **Learning graph alignment:**
   - All chapter concepts mapped (20 pts)
   - Most mapped (15 pts)
   - Some mapped (10 pts)
   - Few mapped (5 pts)

**Content Readiness Ranges:**

- 90-100: Rich content, excellent quiz quality possible
- 70-89: Good content, solid quiz possible
- 50-69: Basic content, limited quiz possible
- Below 50: Insufficient content for quality quiz

**User Dialog Triggers:**

- Score < 60: Ask "Chapter [X] has limited content ([N] words). Generate shorter quiz or skip?"
- No glossary: Ask "No glossary found. Definition questions will be limited. Proceed?"
- Concept gaps: Ask "[N] concepts in chapter not in learning graph. Continue with available concepts?"
- No learning outcomes: Ask "No Bloom's Taxonomy outcomes in course description. Use default distribution?"

### Step 2: Determine Target Distribution

Based on chapter type (introductory, intermediate, advanced), set target Bloom's Taxonomy distribution:

**Introductory Chapters:**
- 40% Remember
- 40% Understand
- 15% Apply
- 5% Analyze
- 0% Evaluate
- 0% Create

**Intermediate Chapters:**
- 25% Remember
- 30% Understand
- 30% Apply
- 15% Analyze
- 0% Evaluate
- 0% Create

**Advanced Chapters:**
- 15% Remember
- 20% Understand
- 25% Apply
- 25% Analyze
- 10% Evaluate
- 5% Create

Determine chapter type by:
- Position in textbook (first 3 chapters = introductory)
- Concept centrality in learning graph (high centrality = advanced)
- Explicit markers in chapter metadata
- User specification

Target question count: 8-12 per chapter (default: 10)

### Step 3: Identify Concepts to Test

Analyze chapter content and learning graph to prioritize concepts:

**Priority 1 (Must Test):**
- High-centrality concepts in learning graph
- Concepts mentioned in chapter title or introduction
- Concepts with dedicated sections
- Key terms emphasized in bold or glossary links

**Priority 2 (Should Test):**
- Supporting concepts with substantial explanation
- Concepts with examples
- Prerequisites reviewed in chapter
- Concepts from learning objectives

**Priority 3 (May Test):**
- Peripheral concepts mentioned briefly
- Related concepts for context
- Future topics previewed

Aim for 80%+ coverage of Priority 1 concepts.

### Step 4: Generate Questions by Bloom's Level

For each concept selected for testing, generate question at appropriate Bloom's level following target distribution.

**IMPORTANT FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:**

All questions MUST use the mkdocs-material question admonition format with upper-alpha list styling:

```markdown
#### 1. What is the primary purpose of a learning graph?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To create visual decorations for textbooks
2. To map prerequisite relationships between concepts
3. To generate random quiz questions
4. To organize files in a directory structure
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A learning graph is a directed graph that maps prerequisite relationships between concepts, showing which concepts must be learned before others. This ensures proper scaffolding in educational content.

    **Concept Tested:** Learning Graph

    **See:** [Learning Graph Concept](../concepts/learning-graph.md)
```

**Formatting Rules:**

1. Use level-4 header (####) with question number
2. Write question as complete sentence ending with ?
3. Use `<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>` wrapper
4. Write 4 answer options as numbered list (1, 2, 3, 4)
5. Use `??? question "Show Answer"` admonition
6. Indent answer content with 4 spaces
7. Start with "The correct answer is **[LETTER]**."
8. Include concept name and link to source
9. Maintain blank line before and after div

**Question Writing Guidelines:**

**Remember Level:**
- Ask for definitions from glossary
- Test fact recall
- Identify terminology
- Example: "What is the definition of [concept]?"

**Understand Level:**
- Ask for explanations
- Test comprehension of relationships
- Compare/contrast concepts
- Example: "Which best describes the relationship between [A] and [B]?"

**Apply Level:**
- Present scenarios requiring concept application
- Test problem-solving using learned methods
- Example: "Given [scenario], which approach would you use?"

**Analyze Level:**
- Ask to identify patterns or causes
- Test ability to break down concepts
- Example: "What is the underlying reason for [phenomenon]?"

**Evaluate Level:**
- Ask for judgments based on criteria
- Test critical thinking
- Example: "Which approach would be most effective for [goal]?"

**Create Level:**
- Ask to design solutions
- Test synthesis of concepts
- Example: "How would you design a [system] that [requirements]?"

### Step 5: Write Quality Distractors

For each incorrect answer option (distractors), ensure:

**Plausibility:**
- Sounds reasonable to someone who hasn't learned the material
- Uses related terminology
- Avoids obviously wrong answers
- Similar length to correct answer

**Educational Value:**
- Addresses common misconceptions
- Tests understanding of related concepts
- Discriminates between levels of knowledge
- Not trick questions or word games

**Common Distractor Patterns:**

- Partial truth (correct in different context)
- Reversal (opposite of correct answer)
- Similar terminology (related but distinct concept)
- Common error (typical student mistake)

**Avoid:**
- "All of the above" or "None of the above"
- Jokes or nonsensical options
- Grammatically inconsistent options
- Answers that overlap or both could be correct

### Step 6: Write Explanations

For each question, write explanation that:

**Confirms Correct Answer:**
- State clearly: "The correct answer is **[LETTER]**."
- Explain why this answer is correct
- Reference chapter content or concept definition
- Target: 50-100 words

**Teaches (Optional but Recommended):**
- Briefly explain why distractors are incorrect
- Clarify common misconceptions
- Provide additional context
- Link to chapter section for more detail

**Example Explanation:**

```
The correct answer is **B**. A learning graph is a directed graph that maps
prerequisite relationships between concepts. Option A is incorrect because
learning graphs serve a structural purpose, not decorative. Option C is
incorrect because quiz generation is not the primary purpose. Option D
confuses learning graphs with file systems.

**Concept Tested:** Learning Graph

**See:** [Learning Graph Concept](../concepts/learning-graph.md#definition)
```

### Step 7: Ensure Answer Balance

Check that correct answers are distributed evenly across A, B, C, D:

**Target Distribution:**
- A: 25% (±5%)
- B: 25% (±5%)
- C: 25% (±5%)
- D: 25% (±5%)

**Avoid Patterns:**
- All C's in a row
- Alternating A-B-A-B
- Predictable sequences
- Position bias (first/last always correct)

**Randomization Strategy:**
- Generate random sequence before writing quiz
- Shuffle for each question
- Verify distribution after completion
- Adjust if imbalanced

### Step 8: Create Quiz File

Generate quiz file with proper structure:

**Option 1: Separate Quiz File** (`docs/[section]/[chapter-name]-quiz.md`):

```markdown
# Quiz: [Chapter Name]

Test your understanding of [chapter topic] with these questions.

---

#### 1. [Question text]?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. [Option 1]
2. [Option 2]
3. [Option 3]
4. [Option 4]
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **[LETTER]**. [Explanation]

    **Concept Tested:** [Concept Name]

    **See:** [Link to chapter section]

---

#### 2. [Question text]?

[Continue for all questions...]
```

**Option 2: Embedded in Chapter** (append to chapter file):

```markdown
[Chapter content...]

---

## Chapter Quiz

Test your understanding with these review questions.

#### 1. [Question text]?

[Continue with quiz questions...]
```

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Use horizontal rules (---) between questions
- Number questions sequentially (1, 2, 3...)
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Ensure all markdown renders correctly

### Step 9: Generate Metadata File

Create `docs/learning-graph/quizzes/[chapter-name]-quiz-metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "chapter": "Chapter Name",
  "chapter_file": "docs/section/chapter-name.md",
  "quiz_file": "docs/section/chapter-name-quiz.md",
  "generated_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",

  },
  "concept_coverage": {
    "total_concepts": 12,
    "tested_concepts": 10,
    "coverage_percentage": 83
  }
}
```

### Step 10: Generate Quiz Bank (Aggregate)

Create or update `docs/learning-graph/quiz-bank.json` with all questions:

```json
{
  "textbook_title": "Building Intelligent Textbooks",
  "generated_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "total_chapters": 20,
  "total_questions": 187,
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "ch1-q001",
      "chapter": "Introduction to Learning Graphs",
      "question_text": "What is the primary purpose of a learning graph?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To create visual decorations for textbooks",
        "B": "To map prerequisite relationships between concepts",
        "C": "To generate random quiz questions",
        "D": "To organize files in a directory structure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A learning graph is a directed graph...",
      "bloom_level": "Understand",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "concept": "Learning Graph",
      "chapter_file": "docs/concepts/learning-graph.md",
      "source_section": "#definition",
      "tags": ["graph", "prerequisites", "scaffolding"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Use for:
- Quiz randomization
- Test variations (A/B versions)
- Practice mode (different questions each time)
- Adaptive difficulty

## Question Format Reference

### Complete Example with All Elements

```markdown
#### 3. Given a course with 50 concepts, what is the most important factor in organizing the learning graph?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Alphabetical order of concept names
2. Prerequisite relationships between concepts
3. The length of concept definitions
4. The visual appearance of the graph diagram
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Prerequisite relationships are the most important factor because they determine the order in which concepts must be learned. A learning graph maps these dependencies to ensure students learn foundational concepts before advanced ones. Alphabetical order (A) and visual appearance (D) are organizational preferences, not educational requirements. Definition length (C) does not affect concept sequencing.
