# FAQ Generator

Generate comprehensive, categorized FAQs from textbook content with Bloom's Taxonomy distribution and chatbot-ready JSON exports.

## Purpose

This skill automates FAQ creation for intelligent textbooks by analyzing course content, learning graphs, and glossary terms to generate relevant questions and answers. The skill organizes questions by category and difficulty, ensures Bloom's Taxonomy distribution across cognitive levels, provides answers with links to source content, and exports structured JSON data ready for RAG system integration.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill after the following artifacts exist:

1. Course description has been finalized
2. Learning graph has been created
3. Glossary has been generated
4. At least 30% of chapter content has been written

Having these prerequisites ensures the FAQ generator has sufficient context to create meaningful, relevant questions. Trigger this skill when:

- Building initial FAQ for a new textbook
- Updating FAQ after significant content additions
- Preparing content for chatbot or AI assistant integration
- Identifying knowledge gaps in existing content

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Content Completeness

Calculate a content completeness score (1-100 scale) to determine FAQ generation feasibility:

**Required Inputs:**

1. Read `docs/course-description.md`
   - Check for: title, audience, prerequisites, learning outcomes
   - Verify Bloom's Taxonomy outcomes present
   - Score: 25 points if complete

2. Read `docs/learning-graph/03-concept-dependencies.csv`
   - Validate DAG structure (no cycles)
   - Count concepts and dependencies
   - Score: 25 points if valid DAG with good connectivity

3. Read `docs/glossary.md`
   - Count terms (50+ = good, 100+ = excellent)
   - Score: 15 points for 100+, 10 for 50-99, 5 for <50

4. Scan all `docs/**/*.md` files
   - Calculate total word count
   - Target: 10,000+ words for comprehensive FAQ
   - Score: 20 points for 10k+, 15 for 5k-10k, 10 for <5k

5. Calculate concept coverage
   - What % of learning graph concepts have related chapter content?
   - Score: 15 points for 80%+, 10 for 60-79%, 5 for <60%

**Content Completeness Score Ranges:**

- 90-100: All inputs present with high quality
- 70-89: Core inputs present, some content gaps
- 50-69: Missing optional inputs or low word count
- Below 50: Critical inputs missing

**User Dialog Triggers:**

- Score < 60: Ask "Limited content available for FAQ generation. Continue with basic FAQ or wait for more content?"
- No glossary: Ask "No glossary found. Generate FAQ anyway (limited technical questions) or create glossary first?"
- Low word count: Ask "Only [N] words of content found. FAQ quality may be limited. Proceed?"

If user agrees to proceed with score < 60, generate FAQ but include disclaimer in quality report about limited content.

### Step 2: Analyze Content for Question Opportunities

Read and analyze all content sources to identify common question patterns:

**From Course Description:**

- "What is this course about?" (scope)
- "Who is this course for?" (audience)
- "What will I learn?" (outcomes)
- "What do I need to know first?" (prerequisites)

**From Learning Graph:**

- "What is [concept]?" (definition questions)
- "How does [concept A] relate to [concept B]?" (relationship questions)
- "What do I need to know before learning [concept]?" (prerequisite questions)
- "What comes after [concept]?" (progression questions)

**From Glossary:**

- "What does [term] mean?" (terminology questions)
- "What's the difference between [term A] and [term B]?" (comparison questions)
- "Can you give an example of [term]?" (application questions)

**From Chapter Content:**

- Identify recurring themes or topics
- Note areas where students might struggle (complex concepts)
- Extract common misconceptions if mentioned
- Find practical application examples

**From Existing FAQ (if present):**

- Read `docs/faq.md` if it exists
- Preserve manually curated questions
- Merge with new generated questions
- Remove duplicates, keeping manual version when conflict

### Step 3: Generate Question Categories

Leaf nodes or advanced concepts without FAQ coverage:

[Continue...]

## Recommendations

1. Add questions for all critical gaps (15 concepts)
2. Consider adding questions for medium priority (23 concepts)
3. Low priority can be addressed in future updates (15 concepts)
```

### Step 9: Validate Output Quality

Perform comprehensive validation:

**1. Uniqueness Check:**

- Scan all questions for duplicates
- Check for near-duplicates (>80% similar)
- Report any duplicates found

**2. Link Validation:**

- Extract all markdown links from answers
- Verify each link target exists
- Report broken links

**3. Bloom's Distribution:**

- Calculate actual distribution across all questions
- Compare to target distribution
- Score based on deviation (±10% acceptable)

**4. Reading Level:**

- Calculate Flesch-Kincaid grade level for answers
- Verify appropriate for target audience
- Flag answers that are too complex or too simple

**5. Answer Completeness:**

- Check each answer addresses the question
- Verify no partial or incomplete answers
- Ensure proper context provided

**6. Technical Accuracy:**

- Cross-reference terminology with glossary
- Verify consistency with chapter content
- Flag any contradictions or inaccuracies

**Success Criteria:**

- Overall quality score > 75/100

- At least 60% concept coverage
- Balanced Bloom's Taxonomy distribution (within ±15%)
- All answers include source references
- Chatbot JSON validates against schema
- Zero duplicate questions
- All internal links valid

### Step 10: Update Navigation (Optional)

If FAQ not in `mkdocs.yml`:

1. Read `mkdocs.yml`
2. Check if "FAQ: faq.md" exists in nav
3. If missing, add in appropriate location (typically near end)
4. Preserve existing structure

- Merge similar questions into one comprehensive answer

**Incomplete Answers:**

- Don't leave questions partially answered
- Don't use "See chapter X for details" without summary
- Always provide standalone context

**Missing Links:**

- Don't forget to link answers to source content
- Use specific section anchors, not just page links
- Verify all links before finalizing

**Poor Question Phrasing:**

- Avoid vague questions like "How does it work?"
- Use specific terminology from glossary
- Make questions searchable

**Bloom's Imbalance:**

- Don't over-focus on Remember/Understand
- Include higher-order thinking questions
- Balance across all 6 levels
