# Course Description

**Title:** Designing and Building Intelligent Textbooks: A Step-by-Step Guide

**Summary:** This course is a 10-week college level course for
students that would like to create intelligent textbooks using generative AI.  It assumes minimal background in education theory and programming.  At the end of this course students will be able to generate their own level-2 interactive textbooks hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

**Intended Audience:** Our audience is primarily college students
that are curious about the future of education. Knowledge of how to create prompts is helpful but not required. Knowledge of how to type commands into a command line interface is also helpful.

**Prerequisites:**
- Students must have a strong understanding of keyboarding skills, how to use a computer mouse and how web browsers work including the concepts of bookmarks and clicking on hyper-text links.
- Students should be familiar with the components of a textbook and their value in a course.
- Students should be able to use a web browser and install software on their local computer.
- Students will be required to install GitHub and Visual Studio Code on their computer.

## Example Usage Instructions

When using this template, replace all bracketed placeholders with specific information for your subject. Be as detailed and specific as possible. For example:

Instead of: "Students will solve problems"
Write: "Students will solve differential equations using the separation of variables method"

Instead of: "Basic math skills"
Write: "Algebra II including quadratic equations, logarithms, and basic trigonometry"

This structured approach ensures your intelligent textbook will have clear learning objectives aligned with Bloom's taxonomy, measurable outcomes, and appropriate interactive elements for effective learning.
