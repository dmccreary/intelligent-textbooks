# Terms to EKG

!!! prompt

    Please create an infographic microsim about the steps that go from a simple list of business terms to a formal knowledge graph of concepts.  Each step has a rectangular box with curved corners and the term in the center of the box.  A hover over the box allows the term definition to appear to the right of the steps.  A click on the box will go to https://dmccreary.github.io/intelligent-textbooks/glossary/#term-name

    Try using a top-down layout using the following stages:

    Here are some sample steps:

    Terms list- just a list of terms and acronyms with no definitions

    Business Glossary - terms with informal definitions

    Controlled Vocabulary - terms with approved definitions

    Taxonomy - some terms have border/narrow terms included

    Ontology - some terms have more detailed related terms

    Semantic Ontology - all relationships between terms have an approved type

    Knowledge Graph - formal typed graph of concepts designed for graph traversal algorithms

    Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) - concepts used consistently by both people and agents across the enterprise and driven by a central data governance process

    AI Enhanced EKG - an EKG at the center of a system that is created, enhanced an monitored by agents

    Real-Time EKG - a EKG that is designed to continually monitor your products, customers, sales, competitors, competing products and empowers real-time agents to advise product managers on how to respond to customer needs and to changes in competing products

    Use the book-gen-workflow.js as your template.

Perfect! I've made all the requested changes:
Changes Made

Reduced box height: Changed from 70px to 40px for more compact display
Description on the right: The description box now appears to the right of the stage boxes, aligned with the hovered stage
Two-column layout:

Left side (~45% width): Stage boxes with vertical flow and arrows
Right side (~55% width): Dynamic description box that appears next to the hovered stage



Additional Improvements

Reduced overall canvas height from 900px to 550px
Smaller vertical spacing between stages (15px instead of 20px)
Description box matches the border color of the hovered stage
Description box automatically adjusts position if it would go off the bottom
More compact text sizes throughout
Instruction box appears in the right area when no stage is hovered

The infographic is now much more compact and all content is visible without scrolling, with descriptions appearing contextually next to each stage as you hover over them.
