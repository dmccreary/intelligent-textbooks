# Book Personas

!!! prompt
    We now have a detailed course description in the file course-description.md in the project area.  For this course description, please create a detailed list of the personas that will be involved in the creation,
    maintenance and use of this textbook.

    Since this textbook will be made for free level-2 usage (content free but no hyper-personalized recommendation engines), anyone might find it from doing an internet search.  Consider students, teachers who want to use the textbook in their classrooms, and parents doing home schooling, people who are curious about the topic.  Note organizations that want to provide level-3 hyper-personalized learning might want to license this textbook.

    List the personas in the frequency order you predict they will arrive at the site. This information can then be used to help organize the site top-level navigation to meet the needs of the most frequent users of
    this book.

    For each persona, create a persona name in a level-3 heading and then describe the persona in detail in the body text. Then create a detailed list of questions they might have and the types of information they are looking for.

    When appropriate, suggest specialized content for each persona.  For example would a "Teachers Guide" be useful with PowerPoint slides?
