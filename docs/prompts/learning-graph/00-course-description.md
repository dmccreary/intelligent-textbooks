# Generating a Course Description

The best way to create a great course is to start with an ultra-high quality
course description.  I would suggest filling out as much information in the content below and then using a generative AI tool like Claude to make suggestions.
Think of this as the high-level specification of the course.

## Example Usage Instructions

When using this template, replace all bracketed placeholders with specific information for your subject. Be as detailed and specific as possible. For example:

Instead of: "Students will solve problems"
Write: "Students will solve differential equations using the separation of variables method"

Instead of: "Basic math skills"
Write: "Algebra II including quadratic equations, logarithms, and basic trigonometry"

This structured approach ensures your intelligent textbook will have clear learning objectives aligned with Bloom's taxonomy, measurable outcomes, and appropriate interactive elements for effective learning.
