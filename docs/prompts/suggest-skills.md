# Suggested Skills

!!! prompt
    I am now getting pretty good at creating Claude Skills.  I have one skill for 
    creating MicroSims and another skill for creating learning graphs.  Based on all the 
    content in this current intelligent-textbooks GitHub repo, what other skills would you
    recommend?  For each skill, suggest what the inputs and outputs would be.  Suggest 
    quality metrics for both inputs and outputs.  For each skill list the inputs, outputs 
    in level two headers.  Use the template at /docs/skills/template.md for each Skill you
    recommend.

## Skill Suggestion Response

I'll analyze the repository to understand the content structure and workflows, then
  recommend additional Claude Skills based on the patterns I find.

### Analysis

Based on my analysis of the repository, I can recommend several additional Claude
  Skills that would complement your existing MicroSim and Learning Graph skills. Let
  me create skill documentation for each recommendation using your template.

     # Glossary Generator Skill
     ## Summary
     This skill automatically generates a comprehensive glossary of terms from a
     learning graph's concept list, ensuring each definition follows ISO 11179
     metadata registry standards (precise, concise, distinct, non-circular, and free
     of business rules).
     ## Order
     This skill should be executed after the Learning Graph skill has completed and
     the concept list has been finalized. The glossary relies on having a complete,
     reviewed list of concepts from the learning graph's concept enumeration phase.
