# Generating a README.md

This prompt works best for argentic tools that build embeddings for all the files in your project.  I use claude code, but I know that Cursor, Windsurf and other tools that work directly on your checked out desktop files.  Make sure you set your context to the location of your checked out code.

    Please update the README.md file to be consistent with GitHub repository best practices.  Put the badges in first and at the end, make sure to put in acknowledgements for all the open source projects used in this course.
