# Social Media Content Generator Skill

## Summary

This skill generates optimized social media preview images and Open Graph metadata for each page in the intelligent textbook, ensuring attractive, informative previews when pages are shared on social platforms, and creates a social media promotion campaign to increase textbook visibility.

## Order

This skill should be executed:

1. After chapter content is substantially complete (70%+ chapters written)
2. After glossary and key pages exist
3. Before major marketing or promotion efforts
4. Can be re-run when content updates significantly

The generator creates custom social cards and promotional content, so it needs actual content to visualize and promote.

## Inputs

### Primary Input Files

1. **All Markdown Content** (`docs/**/*.md`)
   - Extracts titles, descriptions, key concepts

   - Visualizes concept relationships in social cards
   - Highlights key concepts for promotion
   - Quality check: Valid graph structure

3. **MicroSims** (`docs/sims/*/`)
   - Screenshots or animated previews for social sharing
   - Highlights interactive features
   - Quality check: All MicroSims functional

4. **Course Description** (`docs/course-description.md`)
   - Source for course overview messaging
   - Target audience identification
   - Quality check: Clear, compelling description

5. **Site Configuration** (`mkdocs.yml`)

### Input Quality Metrics (Scale 1-100)

**Content Readiness Score:**
- 90-100: Complete content, clear structure, compelling descriptions
- 70-89: Most content ready, some pages lack descriptions
- 50-69: Basic content but many pages lack compelling hooks
- Below 50: Insufficient content for effective social promotion

**Quality Checks:**

1. Page count: 20+ pages = good baseline for promotion
2. Metadata completeness: Titles and descriptions for 90%+ pages
3. Visual assets: Logo, favicon, cover image present
4. Compelling hooks: Key value propositions clear in content
5. Target audience: Clearly defined in course description

**User Dialog Triggers:**
- Score < 60: "Limited content or metadata. Social cards may be generic. Continue or improve content first?"
- No logo: "No logo found. Generate text-based social cards or provide logo first?"
- No course description: "No compelling course description. Social promotion will be limited. Add description?"
- Incomplete metadata: "[N] pages missing titles/descriptions. Generate with defaults or update content?"
