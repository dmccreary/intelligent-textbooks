# SAM: Successive Approximation Model MicroSim

[Run Fullscreen](./main.html)

## Overview

The Successive Approximation Model (SAM) is an agile, iterative approach to instructional design developed by Michael Allen. Unlike the linear ADDIE model, SAM emphasizes rapid prototyping, frequent iteration, and continuous improvement through stakeholder feedback. This interactive MicroSim demonstrates how SAM works and why it's particularly effective for modern instructional design projects.

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, you will be able to:

- Identify the three phases of the SAM process
- Explain how SAM differs from traditional ADDIE
- Understand the value of iterative design and development
- Recognize how quality improves through successive iterations
- Apply SAM principles to instructional design projects

## The Three Phases of SAM

### 1. Preparation Phase (Blue)

The foundation phase where you gather essential information:

**Activities:**
- Gather information about learners and context
- Identify instructional problems and needs
- Define project scope and constraints
- Brainstorm potential solutions with stakeholders

**Duration:** Short and focused (typically 1-2 days)

**Deliverable:** Project brief and initial design ideas

### 2. Iterative Design Phase (Orange)

Rapid cycles of prototyping and refinement:

**Activities:**
- Create quick prototypes (paper, sketches, mockups)
- Review with stakeholders in Savvy Start sessions
- Gather immediate feedback
- Refine design based on input

**Duration:** Multiple short cycles (each 1-3 days)

**Deliverable:** Validated design ready for development

### 3. Iterative Development Phase (Green)

Building and testing with real learners:

**Activities:**
- Build functional content incrementally
- Test with actual learners
- Collect performance data and feedback
- Implement improvements immediately

**Duration:** Multiple sprints (each 1-2 weeks)

**Deliverable:** Continuously improved learning solution

## Key Differences from ADDIE

### ADDIE Approach
- Linear progression through phases
- Complete each phase before starting next
- Extensive upfront planning and documentation
- Testing happens late in the process
- Changes are expensive after development begins

### SAM Approach
- Cyclical, iterative progression
- Rapid prototyping from the start
- Minimal documentation, maximum collaboration
- Testing throughout the entire process
- Changes are expected and welcomed

## Key SAM Principles

### 1. Early and Frequent Prototyping

Don't wait for perfect designs. Create quick mockups and test them immediately:

- Sketches on paper
- PowerPoint mockups
- Simple interactive prototypes
- Rough content samples

**Benefit**: Find problems early when they're cheap to fix

### 2. Collaboration Over Documentation

SAM replaces lengthy documents with collaborative sessions:

- **Savvy Start**: Intensive kickoff workshop with stakeholders
- **Design Proof**: Working prototypes instead of written specs
- **Alpha/Beta Reviews**: Real testing with actual learners

**Benefit**: Faster alignment and better solutions through conversation

### 3. Embracing Change

SAM assumes you'll discover issues and opportunities during development:

- Iterate based on feedback
- Refine as you learn
- Improve continuously
- Welcome new insights

**Benefit**: Final product is better because it evolved based on evidence

### 4. Continuous Improvement

Each iteration through the cycle improves quality:

- **Iteration 1**: Rough but functional
- **Iteration 2**: Clearer based on feedback
- **Iteration 3**: More polished and effective
- **Iteration 4**: Fine-tuned and refined
- **Iteration 5**: High-quality finished product

**Benefit**: Systematic quality improvement with measurable progress

## When to Use SAM

SAM is particularly effective when:

**✓ Requirements are unclear** - Discover what's needed through prototyping

**✓ Stakeholder buy-in is critical** - Involve them throughout the process

**✓ Speed is important** - Deliver faster than traditional approaches

**✓ Innovation is valued** - Encourage creative solutions through iteration

**✓ Learner feedback is available** - Test early and often

**✓ Agile culture exists** - Organization embraces iterative development

## When SAM May Not Fit

Consider alternatives when:

**✗ Strict regulatory compliance** - May require extensive documentation

**✗ Fixed requirements** - Linear approach might be more efficient

**✗ No stakeholder access** - Collaboration is difficult

**✗ Very small projects** - Overhead may not be worth it

**✗ One-time delivery** - No opportunity for iteration

## The Savvy Start Workshop

A key SAM component is the Savvy Start - an intensive collaborative design session:

**Participants:**
- Subject matter experts
- Instructional designers
- Project stakeholders
- Technical team members

**Activities:**
- Brainstorm solutions
- Create rough prototypes
- Test ideas immediately
- Build consensus

**Duration:** Typically 1-3 days

**Outcome:** Aligned team with validated design direction

## Diminishing Returns

Notice in the MicroSim that quality improvements decrease with each iteration:

- **Early iterations**: Large quality jumps (15-20% increase)
- **Middle iterations**: Moderate improvements (10-15% increase)
- **Late iterations**: Fine-tuning (5-10% increase)

**This teaches an important lesson:** Know when to stop iterating and ship!

## Discussion Questions

1. **Compare and Contrast**: How would a project differ if developed using ADDIE vs. SAM?

2. **Risk Management**: Which approach (ADDIE or SAM) better handles uncertainty? Why?

3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: How does SAM ensure stakeholder buy-in throughout the project?

4. **Time to Market**: Can SAM really be faster than ADDIE despite multiple iterations? Explain.

5. **Quality Assessment**: How do you know when you've iterated enough?

## Practical Applications

### For Small Projects

- Use 2-3 iterations maximum
- Combine preparation with first design iteration
- Focus on core functionality

### For Large Projects

- Use 4-5 iterations as shown in MicroSim
- Create multiple prototypes in parallel
- Establish clear iteration criteria

### For eLearning

- Prototype interactions early
- Test with small learner groups
- Iterate based on completion rates and feedback

### For Instructor-Led Training

- Pilot with one class
- Gather instructor and learner feedback
- Refine materials between sessions

## Success Metrics

Track these indicators of SAM effectiveness:

**Time Metrics:**
- Time from start to first prototype
- Time from start to first learner testing
- Total development time vs. ADDIE

**Quality Metrics:**
- Stakeholder satisfaction scores
- Learner performance improvements
- Error rates and confusion points

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- Number of major changes required
- Rework time after initial delivery
- Cost per iteration

## Common Pitfalls

**❌ Insufficient Stakeholder Involvement**
- Solution: Schedule regular review sessions

**❌ Analysis Paralysis**
- Solution: Set time limits for each iteration

**❌ Over-Iteration**
- Solution: Define "good enough" criteria upfront

**❌ Skipping Learner Testing**
- Solution: Make testing mandatory in each cycle

**❌ Poor Prototyping Tools**
- Solution: Use rapid prototyping software

## Reflection

Consider your own experiences:

- Have you ever created something, gotten feedback, and wished you'd tested earlier?
- When has iteration improved one of your projects?
- What would help you embrace an iterative approach?
- How might SAM change your workflow?

## Try This Challenge

Using the MicroSim:

1. Run through all 5 iterations and note the quality at each stage
2. Imagine specific feedback that might occur at each iteration
3. Consider what would happen if you stopped at iteration 3
4. Think about how ADDIE would handle the same project differently
