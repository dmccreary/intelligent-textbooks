## Instructional Design MicroSims - Summary

## ADDIE Workflow Interactive Model

### Purpose

Helps learners explore the five phases of the ADDIE instructional design model and understand its iterative nature.

### Interactive Features

- **Clickable Phase Nodes**: Click on any of the 5 colored circles (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) to see detailed tasks
- **Iteration Arrows**: Toggle to visualize how designers cycle back to earlier phases
- **Animated Flow**: Watch a particle move through the ADDIE workflow
- **Task Checkboxes**: View individual tasks within each phase as checkable items
- **Animation Speed Control**: Slider to adjust flow animation speed

### Canvas Size

800x720px (600px drawing + 120px controls)

### Learning Objectives

- Identify the five phases of ADDIE
- Explain the purpose of each phase
- Understand the iterative nature of instructional design
- Recognize when to cycle back to earlier phases

## Cognitive Load Visualizer

### Purpose

Demonstrates the three types of cognitive load and their impact on working memory capacity.

### Interactive Features

- **Three Load Sliders**: Independently adjust intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load
- **Working Memory Visualization**: "Brain" fills up as total load increases
- **Color-Coded Bars**: See relative contributions of each load type
  - Yellow = Intrinsic load (content difficulty)
  - Red = Extraneous load (poor design)
  - Green = Germane load (learning processes)
- **Real-time Feedback**: Messages about whether load is optimal
- **Good/Bad Examples**: Buttons to load pre-configured scenarios
- **Visual Indicators**: Blue (manageable), orange (near capacity), red (overload)

### Canvas Size

800x650px (500px drawing + 150px controls)

### Learning Objectives

- Identify the three types of cognitive load
- Explain how each type affects learning
- Recognize cognitive overload situations
- Apply load principles to instructional design
- Evaluate materials for cognitive load issues
