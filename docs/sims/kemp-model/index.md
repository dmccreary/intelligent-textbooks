## Key Principles of the Kemp Model

### 1. Holistic Perspective

Kemp views instructional design as an integrated system where all elements affect each other:

- Changes in one element ripple through others
- No element exists in isolation
- The whole is greater than the sum of parts
- Continuous awareness of all factors

**Benefit**: More comprehensive, thoughtful designs

### 2. Flexibility in Sequence

Unlike ADDIE's linear progression, Kemp allows starting anywhere:

- Begin with instructional problems OR learner analysis OR objectives
- Revisit elements multiple times as needed
- No forced sequential progression
- Adapt to project realities

**Benefit**: Responds to real-world constraints and opportunities

### 3. Continuous Revision

All elements can be revised at any time:

- Objectives can change based on learner analysis
- Strategies can shift based on delivery constraints
- Content can adjust based on assessment results
- Iterative refinement throughout

**Benefit**: Accommodates new information and changing conditions

### 4. Learner-Centered Focus

Multiple elements explicitly consider learner needs:

- Learner characteristics as a core element
- Objectives focus on learner performance
- Strategies match learner preferences
- Evaluation measures learner achievement

**Benefit**: Instruction truly serves learner needs

## Comparing Instructional Design Models

### Kemp vs. ADDIE

**ADDIE:**
- Linear, sequential phases
- Must complete each phase before next
- Fixed starting point (Analysis)
- Structured and systematic

**Kemp:**
- Circular, interconnected elements
- Can address elements in any order
- No fixed starting point
- Flexible and adaptive

**When to Use Each:**
- ADDIE: Clear requirements, regulatory needs, traditional contexts
- Kemp: Flexible situations, ongoing projects, complex constraints

### Kemp vs. SAM

**SAM:**
- Iterative cycles through design/development
- Rapid prototyping focus
- Time-boxed sprints
- Agile methodology

**Kemp:**
- Continuous element consideration
- Holistic system view
- Flexible timing
- Adaptive methodology

**When to Use Each:**
- SAM: Quick delivery needed, prototyping culture, unclear requirements
- Kemp: Complex projects, multiple stakeholders, interconnected factors

### Kemp's Unique Value

**What Kemp offers that others don't:**
- Explicit support services element
- Equal emphasis on all factors
- No implied hierarchy or sequence
- Maximum design flexibility

## Practical Applications

### For New Projects

**Starting Point Flexibility:**

- **Problem-driven**: Start with instructional problems when needs are clear
- **Learner-driven**: Start with learner characteristics when audience is known
- **Content-driven**: Start with task analysis when subject matter is defined
- **Assessment-driven**: Start with evaluation when standards are mandated

### For Ongoing Projects

**Revision Flexibility:**

- Revisit learner characteristics when audience changes
- Adjust strategies based on delivery constraints

- Learning scientists focus on instructional strategies
- Technology teams focus on delivery planning

## Discussion Questions

1. **Flexibility**: What are advantages and disadvantages of Kemp's flexibility compared to ADDIE's structure?

2. **Starting Point**: For a corporate training project on new software, which Kemp element would you start with? Why?

3. **Interconnections**: How might changes to "Learner Characteristics" affect other elements in the model?

4. **Application**: Describe a project where Kemp's flexibility would be especially valuable.

5. **Comparison**: When might ADDIE's structure be preferable to Kemp's flexibility?

## Using Kemp in Practice

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Too Much Flexibility

**Problem**: Team feels lost without clear structure

**Solution**:
- Use Kemp for planning but create project timeline
- Define which elements to address in each project phase
- Set milestones for element completion

### Challenge 2: Incomplete Elements

**Problem**: Some elements neglected due to flexibility

**Solution**:
- Create checklist of all nine elements
- Regularly review which elements need attention
- Assign responsibility for each element

### Challenge 3: Inconsistent Elements

**Problem**: Elements don't align due to independent development

**Solution**:
- Regular integration reviews
- Alignment matrices showing element relationships
- Iterative consistency checking

### Challenge 4: Stakeholder Confusion

**Problem**: Stakeholders expect linear ADDIE process

**Solution**:
- Explain Kemp's advantages for their project
- Show how flexibility serves project needs
- Provide regular updates on all elements

## Real-World Example

**Project**: Employee safety training for manufacturing

**Why Kemp Was Chosen**:
- Existing content (task analysis already done)
- Diverse learner population (characteristics crucial)
- Strict regulations (evaluation requirements predefined)
- Multiple delivery constraints (shift work, various locations)

**Approach Using Kemp**:

1. **Started with**: Task analysis (existing safety procedures)
2. **Then addressed**: Evaluation instruments (regulatory requirements)
3. **Next considered**: Learner characteristics (shift workers, language diversity)
4. **Developed**: Instructional objectives aligned with regulations
5. **Designed**: Strategies accommodating shift schedules
6. **Planned**: Delivery for multiple locations
7. **Sequenced**: Content to match existing workflows
8. **Identified**: Support services (translation, scheduling)
9. **Revised**: Objectives based on learner analysis

**Result**: Flexible approach allowed addressing elements as information became available rather than forcing artificial sequence.

## Reflection

Consider your own instructional design experiences:

- Have you ever felt constrained by a linear design model?
- When would starting with learner analysis make more sense than starting with problems?
- How do budget and time constraints affect which elements you address first?
- What happens when you discover important information late in a project?

## Try This Challenge

Using the MicroSim:

1. Click elements in this order: Objectives ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Learners ‚Üí Problems. Explain why this sequence might make sense.

2. Select "Learner Characteristics" and identify which other elements it most directly affects.

3. Imagine a project requirement changes. Which elements would need revision?

4. Compare accessing elements sequentially vs. randomly. How does Kemp accommodate both?

## The Kemp Philosophy

**"Good instructional design is not linear‚Äîit's holistic, flexible, and responsive to real-world constraints."**

The Kemp model acknowledges that:
- Projects don't always start the same way
- Information becomes available at different times
- Constraints change during development
- Flexibility leads to better outcomes

This MicroSim helps you experience and understand this flexible, adaptive approach to creating effective instruction.
