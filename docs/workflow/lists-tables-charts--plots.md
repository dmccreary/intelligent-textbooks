# Lists, Tables Charts and Plots

In this step, we take a look at the Chapter or Section content and we focus on
breaking up the wall of unbroken text with items such as:

1. Lists (bullet lists and numbered lists) - using Markdown lists
2. Tables - using Markdown tabls
3. Simple Charts - bar charts and pie charts using tools like Chart.js
4. Area Charts - time-series plots using tools like chart.js

When you create a chart, place the JavaScript in a file with a name like my-chartt1.js and then
create a my-chart1.html that will render the chart.
Then import that chart into the index.md of the chapter using an `iframe`
